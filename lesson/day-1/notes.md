# Notes

All of the lessons from today will be using a new project.
No need to clone this repository.

We will be touching many topics at a high level,
and later through the week we will go into more detail into some of these topics.

# After Day 1
We left off day one with the challenge to disable the button
when either of the input is not a number.
