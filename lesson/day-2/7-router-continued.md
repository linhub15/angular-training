# Angular Router

More detailed look into Angular Routing.
Let's try to navigate to components after post request is finished.

## Setup Routes
Let's setup routes for all our components
* login
* register
* directory
* add-person

## Create the nav bar
Create the navbar to point to
* directory
* add-person

We can leave the rest for automatic redirects in the future.
When someone is not authenticated they will automatically be redirected to login.

## Create the `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`

## Redirect to components after data is submitted
* login -> directory
* add-person -> directory
